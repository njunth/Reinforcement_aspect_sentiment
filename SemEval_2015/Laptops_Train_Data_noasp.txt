A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.
My HP is very heavy.
Not easy to carry.
The battery has never worked well.
The battery has never worked well.
The battery gets so HOT it is scary.
Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.
Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
Well, they don't care a bunch.
But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
I would Â say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.
In my house, HP is a nasty word.
Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook, I have been very pleased with it, I have a laptob and a desktop.
The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.
The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.

The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.
Its still going.
It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.
You will not regret buying such a great thing like this!
It can't get any better.
Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.

This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!

This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
Acer won't replace the laptop.
the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
This thing is a lemon.
This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.

I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
Buyer Beware.
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!
It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.

Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached.
I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.
I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.
I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I've ever bought.
I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.

And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait.

the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.
The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.

Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?

I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.
Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.
All I can say is W-O-W.
This laptop is insane!!!
It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.

The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.

Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.

I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.

Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
English must have been his third or fourth language.
His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.

I Contacted HPÂ Â about this situation and was given excuses, without results.
They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.
I will never purchase a HP again ever.

But the Macbook is the best!
It is super easy to use.
All you have to do is turn it on and it works.

It is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.
I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.
In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.
I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.

After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.
This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.
Now they are believers in the product.

The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.

So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.
The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.
Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.
Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.
While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.
Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).

The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.

This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.
I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.

They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
We don't Mind and You don't Matter.
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.

The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.
Just a bunch of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.
I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.
Good price.
Basic computer.
Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
It has worked fine.
Handles all my basic media needs easily.
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.

My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.

The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
Enabling the battery timer is useless.
The "Time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)
If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.

This machine delivers.
It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
It is a bit heavy.
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
It also does not have bluetooth.
You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.
Overall, still a very nice machine.
Boots up fast and runs great!
I'm pleased.

Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.
Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.

I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.
Took it back as it was defective.
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
was a great deal i will give that.
the laptop preformed pretty well.
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.
the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
i tried turning it done but it did nothing.
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.

Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.
Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.
Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.

I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highlyÂ dissatisfied with it.
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
Another issue I have with it is the battery.
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.

I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.
I love it so much.
It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.
It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.

The display is awesome.
Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
I think this computer is super lame.
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.
It doesnt work worth a damn.
The display is beyond horrible.
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.
There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
Not to mention it has shit gigs.
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.

In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.

After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.

In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.

Needs constant repair.
First the screen goes completely out.
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.

Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.

So far so good with this laptop.
Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.

The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.
They click.
sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!

I HATE this one.
Vista is a nightmare.
No tutorials on the display.
The book is useless.
The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.

The Macbook is a fantastic laptop.
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
It just works flawlessly!
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.

This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.
It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.

This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.
So far, so good.
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.
I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plasticÂ piecesÂ would come off of it.
Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.
For me, five stars is not enough.
I love the 15" MacBook Pro.
My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.
It was very easy to just pick up and use--
It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.

There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.

No I am generous calling it slow.
its more like a snail crawl.
he can't stand it.
I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.
I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.
the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.

The Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail !
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.

I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.
In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.
I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.

My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.
From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.

Speakers don't get that loud, but good enough.

If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
Never been hacked.
No viruses.
I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
Its also FUN to use!
The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.

I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.

This Laptop is the Best of the best!
The Awesomest of the awesomest.
It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!
My friends are in awe every time they come over!
I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!
It is super fast, and always loads.
I am just amazed.
The only bad part is the size/weight.
It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!

It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.
All for such a great price.
It's color is even cool.
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
They are so realistic I am just speechless.
I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
I don't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.
I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
Ive had to call tech support many times.
Each time taking about 1 day or so.
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
I had to pay for the shipping!
I will never buy anything from HP again!

All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.

what an elegant, wonderful machine.

I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
I really wish I had done this years ago.
Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.
I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.
I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
The computer blinks it shuts off at will.
The letter A stopped working after the first week.

when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.

then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.

I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.

That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.

It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
The graphics are great.
The internet speed is spectacular.

The battery life is probably an hour at best.
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.

At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.

This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
I would recommend not buying this product.
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.

I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.

I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
I waited and waited and no laptop.
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
HP didn't fix it.
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
returned it.
5 months dead again.
They say sorry out of warranty.
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.

I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.
I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.

Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.
They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.

I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!

When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.

I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.

But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
I'm tired of the inept service.
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.

Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.
I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.

It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.
It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.

They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!

i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.

So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
It is held in place magnetically.
There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.

Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.

Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.
I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.

My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
I like this machine because its very lightweight...
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...

I highly recommend that you buy this product.
It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!
I Hate it!
It is the easiest computer I have ever used
I LOVE IT!
I can't say enough good for it!
It's A MAC!!
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.
It's face and depanable.
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
it's just a great toy to have around.

It is truly a Desktop Replacement.
Very fast and efficient!
Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.
Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.

I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!

I never have had a good result with this computer.
I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.

They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.

the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.

so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.

Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
2 months later, the battery went.
They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.

I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
Not worth it one bit.
The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.

Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
And it is impossible to get them back in.
Strengths:Well-shaped
Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
I was said it's videocard.
Very disappointed!
Didn't expect to repair it at once!
Don't buy this model.
An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.
Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).

The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.

My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months.
It started out getting hot after only a few months.
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.
I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.

Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.

In short I would never buy a Compaq again.
I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
The performance is awesome.
I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.

A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
Went silently.
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.
I was so happy with my new Mac.
Then the hard drive failed;
my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
I can't even turn it off.
It's catatonic.
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.

The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
Games being the main issue.
It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!
